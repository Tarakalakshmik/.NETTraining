//4.Create a class library with a function CalculateConcession()  that takes age as an input and calculates concession for travel as below:
//If age <= 5 then “Little Champs - Free Ticket” should be displayed
//If age > 60 then calculate 30% concession on the totalfare(Which is a constant Eg:500 / -) and Display “ Senior Citizen” + Calculated Fare
//Else “Print Ticket Booked” + Fare. 
//Create a Console application with a Class called Program which has TotalFare as Constant, Name, Age.  Accept Name, Age from the user and call the CalculateConcession() function to test the Classlibrary functionality
